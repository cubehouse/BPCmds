# Blueprint Console Commands

This plugin lets you setup console commands in Blueprint quickly.

Make a function starting with "Cmd" and it'll be called when you run the function name from the console!

## Example

Create a Blueprint function called "CmdTest"

Press \` to open the console in-game, and type the command "test". Your Blueprint function will now run!

## Caveats

Your Cmd* function must not return any value.
